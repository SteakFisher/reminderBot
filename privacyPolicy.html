        Our Privacy Policy

    <p>
        <br>
        Believe it or not, I have no idea what to put inside a privacy policy, so I'll just tell you exactly what I use the user data I store for:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Access Tokens: Necessary for the bot to edit your Google Calendar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refresh Token: Necessary for the bot to refresh your Access Token.
            </li>
            <li>
                Discord User Id: Necessary for the bot to correlate you to the data we have stored
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        For now that's it, I doubt I'll need to collect anymore personal data unless the bot blows up,
        but hey by then I may have a lawyer, and then I can wear the fancy suit and things. <br><br>
        Well until then, from me and.. well no one else.. thanks for using reminderBot :D
